# TimeTagger

*Tag your time, get the insight* - an open source time tracker with a focus on
a simple and interactive user experience.

* Website: https://timetagger.app
* Docs: https://timetagger.readthedocs.io
* CLI tool: https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger_cli


## Introduction

TimeTagger is a web-based time-tracking solution that can be run locally
or on a server. In the latter case, you'll want to add authentication,
and also be aware of the license restrictions.

The server runs on async Python using
[uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) and
[asgineer](https://github.com/almarklein/asgineer) - which is fun and bloody fast.
It uses SQLite via [itemdb](https://github.com/almarklein/itemdb) to
store the data, making it easy to deploy.

The client is a mix of HTML, CSS, Markdown, and ... Python!
[PScript](https://github.com/flexxui/pscript) is used to compile the
Python to JavaScript. This may be a bit idiosyncratic, but it's fun!
Maybe I'll someday implement it in something that compiles down to Wasm :)


## Usage example

This repo is organized as a library, making it quite flexible to apply tweaks.
See `run.py` for an example of how to run it as a web app.
See the [docs](https://timetagger.readthedocs.io) for more info.

You can also see it in action at https://timetagger.app - you can
purchase an account for â‚¬3 per month so you don't have to worry about
maintaining a server, backups, and all that. Plus you'd sponsor this
project and open source in general.
