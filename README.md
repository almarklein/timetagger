# TimeTagger

*Tag your time, get the insight* - an open source time-tracker with an
interactive user experience and powerful reporting.

* Website: https://timetagger.app
* Demo: https://timetagger.app/demo
* Docs: https://timetagger.readthedocs.io
* CLI tool: https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger_cli


## Introduction

TimeTagger is a web-based time-tracking solution that can be run locally
or on a server. It's aimed at individuals and freelancers, and has the
following features:

* Intuitive UI based around an interactive timeline.
* Lightweight feel by use of tags rather than projects.
* Reporting in PDF and CSV.
* Set daily/weekly/monthly targets.
* Integrated Pomodoro method.
* Responsive: works well on small and large screens.
* Sync between devices.


## Under the hood

The server runs on async Python using
[uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) and
[asgineer](https://github.com/almarklein/asgineer) - which is fun and bloody fast.
It uses SQLite via [itemdb](https://github.com/almarklein/itemdb) to
store the data, making it easy to deploy.

The client is a mix of HTML, CSS, Markdown, and ... Python!
[PScript](https://github.com/flexxui/pscript) is used to compile the
Python to JavaScript. This may be a bit idiosyncratic, but it's fun!
Maybe I'll someday implement it in something that compiles down to Wasm :)


## Install and run

TimeTagger is a Python library and requires Python 3.6 or higher. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` - these are installed automatically when you install TimeTagger with Pip.

```
# Install
pip install -U timetagger

# Run
python -m timetagger
```

If the server runs on your local machine, you can use single-user mode out-of-the-box.


## Self-hosting your time tracker

A docker image is provided via the [Github container registry](https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger/pkgs/container/timetagger), so you can use e.g. Docker-compose to easily host your
own server.
See the example [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger/blob/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml).
See [this article](https://timetagger.app/articles/selfhost2/) for more information about self hosting.


## Credentials

If you want multiple users, or if the server is not on localhost, you
may want to provide the server with user credentials using an
environment variable or a command line arg (see the
[docs on config](https://timetagger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libapi/)).

```
# Using command-line args
python -m timetagger --credentials=test:$2a$08$0CD1NFiIbancwWsu3se1v.RNR/b7YeZd71yg3cZ/3whGlyU6Iny5i

# Using environment variables
export TIMETAGGER_CREDENTIALS=test:$2a$08$0CD1NFiIbancwWsu3se1v.RNR/b7YeZd71yg3cZ/3whGlyU6Iny5i
python -m timetagger
```

The credentials take the form "<username>:<hash>", where the hash is a
(salted) BCrypt hash of the password. You can generate credentials using
e.g. https://timetagger.app/cred.


## Using the hosted version

You can also make use of https://timetagger.app so you don't have to worry about
maintaining a server, backups, and all that. An account is just â‚¬3 per month.
With that you'd also sponsor this project and open source in general.

## Developers

Clone the repo and install in development mode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger.git
cd timetagger
pip install -e .
```

Install additional developer dependencies:

```
pip install invoke black flake8 pytest pytest-cov requests
```

Then these commands can be used during development:

* `invoke -l` to see available invoke tasks
* `invoke clean` to remove temporary files
* `invoke format` to autoformat the code (using black)
* `invoke lint` to detect linting errors (using flake8)
* `invoke tests` to run tests (using pytest)
