# TimeTagger Contributor License Agreement

## Purpose of this agreement

I love open source! But to protect a 3d party from commercially exploiting TimeTagger, it is licensed under the GPL-3.0. This license (among other things) requires any larger work that uses TimeTagger to be released under the same license.

Copyright counts stronger than a license. Therefore, as the copyright owner, I can use the same code for https://timetagger.app, which also includes proprietary code, or sublicense the code, if I want. However, if *you* make a contribution to TimeTagger, you are the copyright owner of that contribution. Subsequently, I would not be allowed to use your contribution in ways other than GPL-3.0 dictates, which means I would not be able to run https://timetagger.app.

This agreement fixes that. With it, you grant me (Almar Klein) the right to use your contribution for any purpose, just like you can use your contribution in any way you like. To be clear, this agreement does not constrain your rights to use your contribution in any way.


## The legal part

1. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

2. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the TimeTagger project repository (https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger).

3. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the owner of the TimeTagger repository (Almar Klein), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

4. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

5. You are *not* expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
